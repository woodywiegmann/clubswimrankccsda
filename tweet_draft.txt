@cursor — now valued at ~$29.3B — built a wildly good tool, but what puzzles me is this: instead of making it cheap and unlocking exponential creativity for everyone, they charge the people who actually use it most — the hungry, capable coders — the most. It's not just pricing logic, it's missing the chance to empower far more people creatively while still making business sense. There's admiration in the product — but I'm scratching my head at how they turned the people who stand to gain the most into the ones getting ripped off.

It would actually be worth it if those paying fatter margins on tokens and usage could have 30-second zooms with a sentient human being about a workstation or workspace rather than just paying more.
